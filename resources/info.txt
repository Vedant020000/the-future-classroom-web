Check for Bias: AI might occasionally produce biased or incorrect content. Always double-check before sharing with students.
The 80-20 Approach: Use AI for initial work, but make sure to add your final touch, review for bias and accuracy, and contextualize appropriately for the last 20%.
Your Judgment Matters: See AI-generated content as a starting point, not the final version. Always adhere to your school’s guidelines.
Protect Privacy: Don’t include personal student details like names or addresses. We strive to promptly remove any accidentally submitted information.
